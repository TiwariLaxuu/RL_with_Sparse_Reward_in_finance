# Reinforcement Learning with Advanced Exploration Strategies in Finance

This repository demonstrates various techniques to enhance reinforcement learning performance, especially in environments with sparse rewards.

## Techniques Included:
1. **Auxiliary Reward Signal (AR)**
2. **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**
3. **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)**

### 1. Auxiliary Reward Signal
Auxiliary rewards are additional signals that encourage agents to learn useful representations. These signals can improve exploration and enable the agent to achieve better performance. We add an auxiliary task, like predicting the next state of the environment, to help improve learning.

Example code: [Auxiliary Reward Example](#)

### 2. Curiosity-Driven Exploration
Curiosity-driven exploration motivates the agent to explore novel and uncertain areas by providing intrinsic rewards based on prediction errors. The agent becomes "curious" when it encounters situations it hasn't encountered before, driving it to explore more effectively.

Example code: [Curiosity Example](#)

### 3. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)
HER helps the agent learn from failures by redefining goals. After an episode, if the agent does not achieve its goal, it can reinterpret its actions as being successful toward a different, achievable goal.

## Getting Started
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gym torch numpy
